          "A feature that is particularly important for my own assignment was the dashboard screen. On the dashboard there are numerous options that can be customized to fit the driverâ€™s needs. These options can be altered or set using the buttons on the steering wheel. But before the dashboard screen can be used, an emulator had to be created to teach drivers how to operate the buttons.The assignment for my internship was to develop a tool that explains the New Generation trucks new dashboard system and controls to support trainings and presentations. The goal for the project was to build a simulator that the target group can use to interactively learn or teach the new dashboard screen without the truck being present."
